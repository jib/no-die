* Description

No::Die
    Tired of using eval as a straightjacket on modules that have as 
    much interest in life as chronically depressed lemmings? Now 
    there's a 24 hour suicide watch in L<No::Die>. Only modules you 
    permit to die may - the rest will just have to live with it. Their
    distress wil be noted in an error variable and undef will be 
    returned. The ultimate decision of life and death will be left to 
    your application.  

#####################################################################

* Installation

No::Die uses the standard perl module install process:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
